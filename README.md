## Throughout the previous activities, we analyzed video game sales data to identify insights that could be useful for business decisions. In Activity 1, we explored the dataset and identified that the top-selling platforms are Nintendo DS and PlayStation 2, while the top-selling genre is Action. We also noted that sales in North America and Europe are generally higher than sales in other regions.

## In Activity 2, we investigated the relationship between video game sales and their platform and genre. We found that platform and genre have a significant impact on sales, with Action games and games released on the Xbox 360 having the highest average sales.

## In Activity 3, we analyzed the top publishers in the industry and found that Electronic Arts is the top publisher in terms of both the number of games released and total sales. We also identified a positive correlation between the number of games a publisher releases and their total sales.

## In Activity 4, we visualized the sales data using various plots, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and heat maps. These plots helped us identify trends and patterns in the data, such as the positive correlation between sales in different regions and the higher sales for certain platforms and genres.

## In Activity 5, we used regression analysis to investigate the relationship between North American, European, and global sales. We found a strong positive correlation between all three variables, suggesting that North American and European sales are important factors in predicting global sales. We also made predictions of global sales using a multiple linear regression model and found that our predictions were close to the observed values.

## In Activity 6, we used the multiple regression model to make predictions of global sales based on provided values of North American and European sales. Our predictions were close to the observed values, suggesting that the model is accurate in its predictions.

## Overall, the insights gained from this analysis could be useful for businesses in the video game industry when making decisions about platform and genre selection, publisher partnerships, and sales projections. Further exploration could involve investigating other variables that may influence sales and using different modeling techniques to identify potential improvements to the models.
